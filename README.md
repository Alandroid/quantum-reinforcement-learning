# quantum-reinforcement-learning

This repository was created to centraliza all the code used in learning Quantum Deep Q-Learning, in a hybrid clasical-quantum regime, for the supervised project of MS877 - an undergraduate course in Applied Mathematics of the Unversity of Campinas - 2022.

It is split into 2 folders: variational_classifier and quantum_dqn. The former contains the code available in [1], which we used as a step to learn the VQC used in the quantum DQN code, which is itself contained in the latter folder. The code in this directory was mainly based on [2].
