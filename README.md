# quantum-reinforcement-learning

This repository was created to gather all the code used to study Quantum Deep Q-Learning, in a hybrid clasical-quantum fashion, for the project of the discipline MS877 - an undergraduate course in Applied Mathematics of the Unversity of Campinas - 2022.

It is split into 2 folders: variational_classifier and quantum_dqn. The former contains the code available in [1], which we used as a step to learn the VQC used in the quantum DQN code, which is itself contained in the latter folder, which code was mainly based on [2].
